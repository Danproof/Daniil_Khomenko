To run tests you need to be in the same directory where the 'feature' directory is.

To see the report in terminal just run 'behave --no-capture', after each scenario you can see 'True' if there are no errors or 'False' otherwise.

To see the html report in your browser use:
1. 'behave -f html -o behave-report.html' (this command creates html report)
2. 'start behave-report.html'(this command open it in browser)
